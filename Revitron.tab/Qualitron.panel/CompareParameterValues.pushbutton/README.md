# Compare Parameter Values

Sets color overrides for all elements in current view that have the selected paramter. Elements with the same value as the original element will be colored green, the other values will automatically get a set of easily distingushable colors assigned. Once there are no more default colors available, all remaining elements will be colored the same. 
It does not make sense to have more than ca. 15 different colors in your view that you cannot differenciate anyway.

How To Use:
1. Select an object
2. Click the *Compare Parameter Values* button
3. Choose the parameter that you want to compare values for.

> Use the *Isolate* switch to only show elements that acutally have the parameter.
