Compare Values
==============

The *Compare Parameter Values button* can be seen as the little brother of the :doc:`rules`.
While model rules outline the standards your model should adhere to, Compare Parameter Values is used to quickly visualize if other elements share the same value in a parameter with the selected object.
Coupled with your knowledge about the project you have a powerful tool at hand that helps you to keep your model in check.
