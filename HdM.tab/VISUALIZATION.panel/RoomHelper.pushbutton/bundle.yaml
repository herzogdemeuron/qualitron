  Visualize Rooms in 3D


  How to Use:


  1. Select a level, then click "Visualize" to begin. This action creates 3D representations of the selected rooms.


  2. All parameters associated with the selected rooms are automatically transferred to the corresponding 3D instances.


  3. Upon closing the script, all generated 3D instances are automatically purged to maintain a clean workspace. If you wish to keep any instances, ensure to 'bake' them into the model.


  4. To emphasize specific rooms, select their 3D instances and activate the script button once more. This highlights the chosen rooms for easy identification.


  5. Utilize tools like "Color Splasher" or "Colorize Selections" to apply color to the 3D instances, enhancing their visual distinction.

  
  Troubleshooting Tip: If you encounter any rooms that cannot be visualized, inspect and clean their boundaries for improved results.
